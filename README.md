# XGBoost-Airline-Data
XGBoost Model Used to Identify Most Important Features That Drove Dissatisfaction Among Flyers

In this project, I build a XGBoost classification model, using the airline dataset that I previously
used in building a decision tree and random forest models, and then compare the performance of
the three models. The ultimate goal is to decide which model is best.

Lastly, I explore the features importance that most contribute to customer satisfaction, as revealed
by my XGBoost model.
