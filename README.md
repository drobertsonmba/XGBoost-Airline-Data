# XGBoost-Airline-Data
XGBoost model is used to identify the most important features that drove dissatisfaction among it's flying customers.

In this project, I build a XGBoost classification model to predict which flyer customers are satisfied and dissatisfied,
using the airline dataset that I previously used in building the decision tree and random forest models.  
I then compare the prediction performance of the three models. The ultimate goal is to decide which model is best.

Lastly, I explore the features importance that most contribute to customer satisfaction, as revealed
by my XGBoost model.
